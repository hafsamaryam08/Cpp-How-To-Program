Ch#1: Into to Computers and C++

C evolved from two previous languages: BCPL and B
BCPL - Martin Richards - 1967
B - Ken Thompson - 1970
C++ evolved from C
C - Dennis Ritchie - Bell Laboratories - 1972
C++ - an extension of C - Bjarne Stroustrup - Bell Laboratories - 1979
Originally called "C with classes" - renamed to C++ in 1980s
C++ programs consist of pieces called classes and functions
C++ systems consist of three parts: a program development environment, 
the language and the C++ Standard Library
